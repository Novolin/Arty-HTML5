# HTML5 Artillery Clone
This is the HTML5 artillery clone i've been putting off finishing for too long
It's a small and manageable sized game i think!!!


## TODO:
* Rewrite render code to be more modular/object-based
* rewrite collision detection code to actually fucking work
* smooth out bullet travel
* make the menus show up and work.
* switch cannons from being spheres to bezier curves
* make land use lineJoin = round
* use a separate canvas for menus?
* figure out clicking/mouse detection
